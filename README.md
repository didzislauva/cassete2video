## Introduction

In preserving cassette recordings and sharing them on digital platforms like YouTube, converting audio files into video format is a crucial step. This enhanced script automates the process of converting cassette audio files and static images into a video file, ensuring that the images meet the necessary format requirements.

## The Enhanced Script: Key Features and Functionality

The provided script offers an improved approach to converting audio and image files into video. It addresses some additional aspects of image processing, particularly focusing on ensuring that both the width and height of the image are compatible with video encoding standards.

### Script Breakdown

#### Initial Setup

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
The script begins by disabling command echoing with @echo off and enabling delayed variable expansion with setlocal enabledelayedexpansion. This setup is essential for managing variables dynamically within the script.

User Input
batch
Copy code
:: Prompt user for the key (t for last 10 seconds, a for full MP3)
echo Enter the key (t for last 10 seconds, a for full MP3):
set /p key=

:: Debugging output
echo Key entered: "%key%"

:: Prompt user for the image file path
echo Enter the path to the image file:
set /p image_file=

:: Prompt user for the audio file path
echo Enter the path to the audio file:
set /p audio_file=

:: Prompt user for the output video file name
echo Enter the output video file name:
set /p output_file=
The script prompts the user for necessary input:

Key: Determines whether to use the last 10 seconds of audio (t) or the entire audio file (a).
Image file path: Location of the image to be used in the video.
Audio file path: Location of the audio file.
Output video file name: Desired name for the resulting video.
File Existence Check
batch
Copy code
:: Check if the image file exists
if not exist "%image_file%" (
    echo The image file does not exist.
    exit /b 1
)

:: Check if the audio file exists
if not exist "%audio_file%" (
    echo The audio file does not exist.
    exit /b 1
)
The script verifies that both the image and audio files exist. If either file is missing, it prints an error message and exits.
```

#### Image Dimensions Verification
#### Getting Dimensions

```batch
:: Get the image width and height using ffprobe and store them in separate temporary files
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "%image_file%" > width.txt
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=height -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 "%image_file%" > height.txt
```
The script uses ffprobe to retrieve the width and height of the image, saving these values in separate temporary files (width.txt and height.txt). The dimensions are then read from these files and the temporary files are deleted.

### Why Even Dimensions Matter
Video codecs, such as H.264 used by ffmpeg, often require that the width and height of the image be divisible by 2. This requirement ensures efficient encoding and decoding, as many video processing techniques, like chroma subsampling, depend on even dimensions. Images with odd dimensions can lead to complications in video processing and playback issues.

### Checking and Adjusting Image Dimensions

```batch
:: Check if ffprobe was successful
if "%width%"=="" (
    echo Failed to get the image width.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

if "%height%"=="" (
    echo Failed to get the image height.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

:: Display the width and height
echo Width: %width%
echo Height: %height%

:: Check if width is divisible by 2
set /a width_result=width %% 2

:: Check if height is divisible by 2
set /a height_result=height %% 2

:: Initialize cropping flag
set crop_needed=0

if !width_result! neq 0 (
    echo Width is not divisible by 2
    set /a crop_needed=1
)

if !height_result! neq 0 (
    echo Height is not divisible by 2
    set /a crop_needed=1
)
```

The script checks if the width and height values were successfully retrieved. It then verifies if these dimensions are divisible by 2. If either dimension is not divisible by 2, the script sets a flag to indicate that cropping is needed.

### Cropping the Image
```batch
:: Check if cropping is needed
if !crop_needed! neq 0 (
    echo Cropping 1 pixel from the width or height to make it divisible by 2...

    :: Extract only the filename and extension from the input file
    for %%f in ("%image_file%") do (
        set "filename=%%~nf"
        set "extension=%%~xf"
        set "filepath=%%~dpf"
    )

    :: Define a temporary output file name in the same directory as the input file
    set "cropped_image=!filepath!!filename!_cropped!extension!"

    :: Display the file names for debugging
    echo Input file: "%image_file%"
    echo Output file: "!cropped_image!"

    :: Crop the image to remove 1 pixel if needed
    ffmpeg -i "%image_file%" -vf "crop=iw-mod(iw\,2):ih-mod(ih\,2)" "!cropped_image!"

    :: Check if cropping was successful
    if exist "!cropped_image!" (
        echo Image cropped successfully.
        echo Overwriting the original image with the cropped image.
        move /y "!cropped_image!" "%image_file%"
    ) else (
        echo Failed to crop the image. Check the command and file formats.
        pause
        exit /b 1
    )
)
```

If cropping is needed, the script generates a temporary file name for the cropped image. It uses ffmpeg with the crop filter to adjust the dimensions to be divisible by 2. The command -vf "crop=iw-mod(iw\,2):ih-mod(ih\,2)" adjusts the width and height if necessary. After cropping, it checks if the new image file exists and replaces the original image with the cropped version if successful.

### Video Creation Based on User Input
```batch
:: Debugging output
echo Input image file: "%image_file%"
echo Audio file: "%audio_file%"
echo Output video file: "%output_file%"

:: Process based on the key
if /i "%key%"=="t" (
    echo Key is 't'
    echo Processing with last 10 seconds of audio...
    ffmpeg -loop 1 -i "%image_file%" -i "%audio_file%" -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -preset ultrafast -b:v 500k -c:a copy -shortest -r 1 -t 10 "%output_file%"

) else if /i "%key%"=="a" (
    echo Key is 'a'
    echo Processing with full audio...
    ffmpeg -loop 1 -i "%image_file%" -i "%audio_file%" -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -preset ultrafast -b:v 500k -c:a copy -shortest -r 1 "%output_file%"

) else (
    echo Invalid key. Please enter 't' for last 10 seconds or 'a' for full MP3.
    exit /b 1
)
```
Based on the userâ€™s input key, the script uses ffmpeg to generate the video:

* **Key t:** Uses the last 10 seconds of the audio file.
* **Key a:** Uses the entire audio file.
The ffmpeg command parameters:

* **-loop 1:** Loops the image throughout the video.
* **-i "%image_file%":** Input image file.
* **-i "%audio_file%":** Input audio file.
* **-c:v libx264:** Video codec.
* **-tune stillimage:** Optimization for still images.
* **-preset ultrafast:** Fast encoding with reduced compression efficiency.
* **-b:v 500k:** Video bitrate.
* **-c:a copy:** Copies the audio stream.
* **-shortest:** Matches the video duration to the shortest input.
* **-r 1:** Sets frame rate to 1 fps.

### Final Steps

```batch
endlocal
pause
```
The script concludes by restoring the previous environment settings with endlocal and keeping the console window open with pause for user review.
